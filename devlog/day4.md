Benchmark tests sound useful for a real game: https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/library-features/test.html
and can probably help me understand how to write better Rust code. Might be cool to benchmark test and make
modifications to optimize and figure out the general patterns.

Thinking about implementing ECS pattern from the beginning:

How would the different Systems know about the associated Entities? Standard approach seems to be some sort of
event queue -- I haven't learned any multithread/processing or asynchronous techniques in Rust yet.

How do the draw and input threads synchronize with the other threads? From my understanding, there's typically
a main "tick" for games where all actions are computed. What is the tick timing, how's it relate to framerate,
how do I sync things?

I should probably use a fine-grained threading approach for other multiprocessing work.

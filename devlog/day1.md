# Day 1

Started Rust book -- got to the end of Chapter 6.

Wrote the exciting "guess the number" game.

Looked up graphics libraries -- gfx-rs looked cool.

Set up Rust dev environment & VSCode: cargo, rustup, racer, etc.

Ownership system is cool approach to memory management.

Started learning about structs, wrote first pass at ones to represent core game classes.

How do I manage lifetimes? Would probably be better to pass references for some things here...

Should I use enum or struct for GameEntity? https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html#enum-values
